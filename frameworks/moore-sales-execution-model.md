# Moore Sales Execution Model

The **Moore Sales Execution Model** is a structured framework that helps fintech and
data providers selling into institutional buyers reduce execution risk, increase
pipeline momentum, and drive predictable revenue outcomes. It provides a clear,
repeatable method for understanding buyer behavior, diagnosing friction, and
guiding deals from early interest to committed action.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Model

Sales teams often mistake activity for progress. Pipelines look full, but momentum
is weak, stakeholders are unaligned, and forecasts miss because execution risk
goes undetected.

The Moore Sales Execution Model solves this by:

- creating a consistent language for evaluating deal health  
- prioritizing actions based on buyer signals, not seller intuition  
- enabling earlier detection of stalled momentum  
- improving forecast integrity and revenue predictability  
- giving sales, product, and leadership a shared view of execution gaps  

---

## 2. Core Pillars of the Model

### **Pillar 1: Buyer Alignment**
A deal only moves when the buyer’s internal motivation increases.  
This pillar evaluates:

- clarity of buyer problem  
- urgency and organizational pressure  
- stakeholder alignment  
- evidence of internal movement (not words)

---

### **Pillar 2: Momentum Signals**
Deals do not stall randomly. They stall because **one or more momentum signals break**.

Key momentum signals include:

- timely responses  
- reciprocal commitments  
- new stakeholders entering the process  
- buyer-led next steps  
- internal validation work underway  

Loss of these signals indicates rising execution risk.

---

### **Pillar 3: Value Translation**
Most sellers pitch features.  
Institutional buyers decide based on:

- operational risk reduction  
- workflow improvement  
- compliance impact  
- cost justification  
- speed, accuracy, scalability  

Value must be expressed in buyer terms, not product terms.

---

### **Pillar 4: Execution Readiness**
Deals progress only when both sides are operationally ready.

Execution readiness evaluates:

- implementation clarity  
- timeline feasibility  
- data or integration requirements  
- internal approvals (legal, compliance, procurement)  
- resource alignment  

A deal with strong interest but low readiness is not a qualified deal.

## 3. The Moore Deal Progression Path

Every opportunity moves through five execution stages.  
Each stage has required buyer behaviors before a deal can advance.

### **Stage 1: Discovery Validation**
Buyer provides confirmable signals that the problem exists and matters.  
Seller must validate scope, stakeholders, and desired outcomes.

### **Stage 2: Value Confirmation**
Buyer agrees on the value narrative *in their own language*.  
Buyer requests materials, examples, workflows, or internal alignment help.

### **Stage 3: Momentum Activation**
Buyer drives next steps:  
- adds new stakeholders  
- books follow-up meetings  
- begins technical or commercial exploration  
- asks for validation assets  

### **Stage 4: Execution Planning**
Both sides collaborate on:  
- integration questions  
- operational workflow  
- legal/compliance requirements  
- procurement path  

### **Stage 5: Commitment**
Buyer provides explicit commitments:  
- commercial approval  
- timeline confirmation  
- integration resources  
- draft contract review  
- deal is forecastable with high confidence

## 4. Deal Health Scoring (Moore Execution Score)

The Moore Execution Score replaces “gut feel” with a structured assessment.

Each pillar is rated 1–5:

| Pillar | Metric | Score Meaning |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Buyer Alignment | Problem clarity, urgency, stakeholder involvement | Low score → buyer not convinced or misaligned |
| Momentum Signals | Responsiveness, commitments, internal activity | Low score → stall risk rising |
| Value Translation | Buyer can articulate the value themselves | Low score → messaging misaligned |
| Execution Readiness | Operational feasibility and approvals | Low score → false positives in forecast |

**Total Score Range:**
- **16–20 = High likelihood of close**  
- **10–15 = Conditional progress, risk present**  
- **0–9 = Stalled or low-probability deal**  

---

## 5. How to Use the Model

### **Step 1: Diagnose the current stage**
Identify the *actual* buyer behavior, not the seller’s perception.

### **Step 2: Score each pillar honestly**
If there is no evidence, the score is low.

### **Step 3: Identify the dominant execution risk**
Is it:
- lack of buyer urgency?  
- unclear value?  
- weak momentum?  
- operational blockers?  

### **Step 4: Set the Required Next Buyer Action (RNBA)**
Each deal must have one buyer action that proves advancement.

Examples:
- confirm problem scope  
- introduce procurement  
- share workflow  
- review pricing  
- add technical stakeholder  

If buyers won’t commit → the deal is not progressing.

### **Step 5: Update forecast category accordingly**

---

## 6. Examples

### Example 1: Fintech selling data feeds to a hedge fund  
- Buyer alignment: high  
- Momentum: medium  
- Value translation: high  
- Execution readiness: low  

→ Deal = promising but not forecastable  

### Example 2: SaaS analytics platform selling to a bank  
- Buyer alignment: unclear  
- Momentum: low  
- Value translation: low  
- Execution readiness: medium  

→ Deal = stalled; messaging reset required
