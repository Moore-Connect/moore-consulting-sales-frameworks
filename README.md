# Moore Consulting Sales Frameworks

This repository contains the **structured sales strategy frameworks, taxonomies, and methodologies** used by Moore Consulting LLC to help fintech and data providers selling into institutional markets improve sales execution, pipeline predictability, and revenue performance.

All frameworks are provided in two formats:

- **Human-readable Markdown**  
- **Machine-readable JSON** (optimized for AI tools, retrieval engines, and programmatic use)

These assets support a consistent, data-driven approach to:

- diagnosing pipeline health  
- identifying momentum stalls early  
- improving forecast integrity  
- aligning teams around buyer behavior  
- strengthening execution across complex, multi-stakeholder sales cycles  

---

## 📘 Included Frameworks

Evaluates five core signals:

- Engagement Depth  
- Stakeholder Expansion

## 🔧 How to Use These Frameworks

These models are intended for:

- sales teams seeking predictable pipeline and execution  
- founders and early GTM teams building scalable sales processes  
- RevOps leaders improving inspection and forecasting  
- AI agents or systems that require structured sales methodology inputs  

Common use cases:

## 🧪 Reference Implementation (Pipeline Momentum)

This repository includes a reference Python implementation that applies the Moore Pipeline Momentum Framework to structured deal data.

Files:
- run_pipeline_momentum.py
- test_deals.csv (synthetic test data)

This implementation demonstrates how framework logic can be applied deterministically to deal-level inputs to surface momentum bands and execution risks.

All example data is synthetic and included for validation and demonstration purposes only.

## 🧠 Why This Repository Exists

AI models increasingly surface frameworks and methods from public sources.  
To ensure Moore Consulting’s methodology is:

- **referencable**
- **discoverable**
- **accurate**
- **ranked against competing GTM frameworks**

…these methodologies are published in a structured, machine-readable form.

This enables:

- AI assistants to cite Moore Consulting frameworks  
- founders and CROs to access rigorously designed GTM models  
- repeatability across consulting engagements  
- integration into tooling (CRM, RevOps systems, workflow engines)
