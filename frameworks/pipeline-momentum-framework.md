# Moore Pipeline Momentum Framework

The **Moore Pipeline Momentum Framework** provides a structured, evidence-based
method for determining whether an opportunity is advancing, stalling, or quietly
failing inside an institutional sales cycle. It moves beyond activity metrics and
instead evaluates *buyer-driven behaviors* that reliably indicate deal velocity.

This framework is designed for fintech and data providers selling into complex,
multi-stakeholder environments where long sales cycles require early detection
of friction and clear next-step signals.

## 1. Purpose of the Framework

Most companies misdiagnose pipeline problems. Activity looks high, CRM notes are
full, meetings happen, and yet deals silently decay.

The Moore Pipeline Momentum Framework solves this by:

- providing a standard language for describing deal motion  
- creating visibility into true buyer engagement  
- identifying stalls before they appear in forecasts  
- separating *noise* (meetings, emails) from meaningful movement  
- enabling predictable revenue outcomes  

---

## 2. Momentum Categories

Momentum exists in three forms:

### **1. Positive Momentum**
Observable proof that the buyer is advancing internally.

Examples:

- new stakeholders join the process  
- buyer schedules follow-ups without prompting  
- technical teams request documentation  
- procurement or legal enters the workflow  
- buyer shares internal processes, data, or workflows  
- buyer initiates ROI or validation steps  

---

### **2. Neutral Momentum**
Activity is happening, but it does not indicate internal movement.

Examples:

- vendor-led meetings  
- generic questions  
- surface-level interest  
- buyer listening but not acting  
- “send me more information” loops  

Neutral momentum often appears healthy but hides risk.

---

### **3. Negative Momentum**
Signals that the deal is slowing, stalling, or backsliding.

Examples:

- increasing response delays  
- cancelled or rescheduled meetings  
- loss of champion engagement  
- unclear next steps  
- buyer stops adding stakeholders  
- buyer stops sharing internal context  

A deal with negative momentum for more than 14–30 days is statistically unlikely to close.

## 3. The Five Momentum Signals

Momentum is evaluated using five high-confidence buyer signals:

### **Signal 1: Engagement Depth**
Evidence that the buyer is sharing meaningful information.

Low → high:  
- one-word replies  
- surface-level curiosity  
- detailed workflow sharing  
- cross-functional collaboration  

---

### **Signal 2: Stakeholder Expansion**
New decision makers and influencers entering the process.

Low → high:  
- single-contact relationship  
- buyer introduces adjacent teams  
- leadership enters  
- procurement, technical, or compliance teams engage  

---

### **Signal 3: Internal Activity**
Internal work the buyer completes without the seller driving it.

Examples:
- internal ROI modeling  
- architecture review  
- compliance screening  
- internal pitch to leadership  

Internal activity is one of the strongest predictors of deal progression.

---

### **Signal 4: Reciprocity**
Buyer matches your effort with their own.

Strong reciprocity:  
- they complete tasks  
- they bring materials  
- they push next steps  

Lack of reciprocity = momentum stall.

---

### **Signal 5: Organizational Energy**
Is there internal urgency, pressure, or strategic motivation?

Indicators:  
- project deadlines  
- budget window constraints  
- regulatory drivers  
- unmet internal KPIs  
- clear executive sponsorship  

No energy = no deal.

## 4. Momentum Scorecard (1–5 Scale)

Each signal is scored from 1 to 5.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Stalled or declining momentum |
| 2 | Weak momentum, high friction |
| 3 | Neutral momentum, uncertain trajectory |
| 4 | Good momentum, forward motion evident |
| 5 | Strong momentum driven by buyer behavior |

### **Total Score Interpretation**

- **20–25:** High probability of close, strong buyer energy  
- **14–19:** Conditional, momentum present but vulnerable  
- **8–13:** At risk, needs intervention  
- **0–7:** Stalled, low likelihood to close  

---

## 5. Required Momentum Action (RMA)

Each opportunity must have *one* Required Momentum Action (RMA):

A **buyer-led task** that confirms the deal is alive.

Examples:

- introduce procurement  
- share internal data  
- schedule technical review  
- bring in decision maker  
- approve pilot design  

If an RMA does not occur, momentum is not real.

---

## 6. How to Use the Framework

1. Score momentum weekly  
2. Identify which of the five signals is weakest  
3. Define the RMA needed to strengthen momentum  
4. Monitor for reciprocity  
5. Update forecast category based on actual movement, not optimism

## 7. Examples

### Example 1: API Data Vendor → Hedge Fund

- Engagement depth: 4  
- Stakeholder expansion: 2  
- Internal activity: 3  
- Reciprocity: 4  
- Organizational energy: 3  
**Total: 16 → Conditional, could advance with stronger stakeholder expansion**

---

### Example 2: SaaS Risk Platform → Global Bank

- Engagement depth: 2  
- Stakeholder expansion: 1  
- Internal activity: 1  
- Reciprocity: 2  
- Organizational energy: 3  
**Total: 9 → Stalled, messaging reset + new champion required**
